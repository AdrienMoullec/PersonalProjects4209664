Website project:

I have been mostly experimenting with how the layout of the websites work. I have found out a lot about the coding structure and Tailwind keywords, and I'm working from the Duolingo website tutorial by Code with Antonio.
I am planning to practice by replicating well known website structures like Youtube.
I also want to learn how to set up databases wth either neon console or firebase and hopefully be able to make a portfolio from my framework.
